## Description:
You can search 6 day weather forecast with daily average parameters. Search by city name or city name, state and country code. no spaces between parameters. Here's a visual:

* {city name}

* {city name},{state}

* {city name},{country code}

* {city name},{state},{country code}

**_Please note,_ that searching by states available only for the USA locations.**

A list of country codes can be found [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes#Current_ISO_3166_country_codes)
